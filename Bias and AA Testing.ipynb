There is the possibility that the customers do not know about the new promotion, how is was the program advertised? There is the possibility that there could be something not functional about the program, such as it might not work, the coupons might be for things people don't want, the employees might not even know about it or they might not be using the program for some reason. There is even the possibility that the program is working, however something else is driving down the numbers, such as unavailable products, an increase in prices or competition is gaining popularity recently. Lastly, the customers might like the product so much the small price difference does not matter, or perhaps the clients are so wealthy that small savings are irrelevant to them. "
