    "Q: Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.\n",
    "The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

    "    A: The problem is that in order to best rule the universe we need to have the most effective slogan for gaining new recruits. The potential solution in finding that slogan is that we will have the same talented speaker pitching each slogan to two different yet similar groups. We would run A/B testing and compare the slogans by evaluating the results from the two similar groups that are the same size. After the same speaker performs both slogans to the two groups we can compare the results and determine which slogan in fact gained the most recruits. "
