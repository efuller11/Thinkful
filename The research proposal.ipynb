    "Q: Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.\n",
    "The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

    "    A: The problem is that in order to best rule the universe we need to have the most effective slogan for gaining new recruits. The potential solution is that we will have similar speakers pitching each campaign for random groups. To verify, we will perform A/A tests to verify the groups are in fact similar. After performing the both slogans to many groups we can compare data and determine which slogan in fact gained the most recruits. "
